# Mobile API Improvements

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Server Timeout Issues
- **Before**: 20-second timeout was too short for mobile networks
- **After**: Increased to 45 seconds to accommodate slow mobile connections and wallets with many IP assets
- **File**: `server/routes/check-ip-assets.ts`

### 2. Memory Optimization
- **Before**: Server collected all IP assets in memory before counting (could cause slowdowns with large portfolios)
- **After**: Count assets on-the-fly during pagination, reducing memory usage
- **File**: `server/routes/check-ip-assets.ts`

### 3. Client-Side Timeout & Retry
- **Before**: No client-side timeout; mobile users waited indefinitely with no feedback
- **After**: 
  - 60-second client timeout with AbortController
  - Automatic retry (up to 2 retries) for timeout and server errors
  - Better error messages for mobile users
- **File**: `client/pages/IpAssistant.tsx`

### 4. Error Handling Improvements
- Better error messages for 504 timeouts
- Exponential backoff between retries
- Specific guidance for mobile network issues

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test on actual mobile devices** (Android/iOS) with:
   - 3G/4G network (not just WiFi)
   - Wallets with 50+ IP assets
   - Poor signal conditions

2. **Expected behavior**:
   - Request completes within 45 seconds for most wallets
   - Automatic retry on timeout (user sees retry in console)
   - Clear error message if all retries fail

3. **Monitor in production**:
   - Track 504 error rates
   - Monitor average response times
   - Check retry success rates

## Deployment Notes

### Netlify
- Free tier: 10-second function timeout (may still cause issues)
- Pro tier: 26-second function timeout (better but still tight)
- Business tier: 60-second function timeout (recommended for this use case)

If using Netlify Free tier and experiencing timeouts, consider:
1. Reducing `maxIterations` from 10 to 5 in `server/routes/check-ip-assets.ts`
2. Upgrading to Pro tier for longer function timeouts
3. Using a different hosting platform (Vercel, Railway, Render) with longer timeouts

### Alternative Hosting
- Vercel: 10s (Hobby), 60s (Pro)
- Railway/Render: No function timeout limits (long-running processes OK)

## Future Improvements

1. **Pagination on client**: Return partial results and let client fetch more pages
2. **Background jobs**: For wallets with 100+ assets, use async job + polling
3. **Caching**: Cache results per address (invalidate after 5 minutes)
4. **WebSocket updates**: Stream counts as they're fetched instead of waiting for completion
