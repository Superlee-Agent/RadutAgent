        "visionDescription": "A cartoon-style illustration of a yellow bird with a round face and wide, expressive eyes. The bird has an orange beak and is wearing a blue and beige winter hat with a pom-pom. The background is solid black, which contrasts with the bright colors of the character, making it stand out. The drawing has bold outlines and a simplistic, playful style."
